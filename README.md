# My Wedding Website

This is my personal wedding website, crafted with a lot of love and Web Standards. I didn't use any third-party libraries as dependency, only HTML5, CSS3 & plain 🍦JavaScript and that's was really fun work. I used Parcel (https://parceljs.org) as a bundler tool, surge (https://surge.sh) for hosting the webpage (http://daniel-e-paula.surge.sh/) and, at the development phase, I used contentful (https://www.contentful.com) for fetching all content on the page.

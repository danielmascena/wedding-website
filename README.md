# wedding-website

This is my personal wedding website, crafted with a lot of love and Web Standards. I didn't use any third-party libraries as dependency, only HTML5, CSS3 & plain üç¶JavaScript and that's was really fun work. I used Parcel (https://parceljs.org) as a bundler tool and surge (https://surge.sh) for hosting the webpage (http://daniel-e-paula.surge.sh/).
